This notebook attempts to provide some insight into how Jupyter notebooks can improve the workflow of a user who is already well-versed in GAP."

    "In Jupyter, code is split into a number of cells. While these cells may look independent from one another, and can be run independently, there is some interconnectedness between them. One major example of this is that variables defined in one cell are accessible from cells that are run **after** the cell containing the variable. The value of the variable will be taken from the **most recent** assignment to that variable:"
